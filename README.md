# Data Narratives Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and building data narratives â€“ the process of formulating non-trivial questions and uncovering their answers through analysis of datasets derived from observations and explorations.

## Description

Data narratives offer a structured approach to understanding complex datasets, guiding the exploration process, and communicating insights effectively. In this repository, we delve into various datasets, pose insightful questions, and leverage data analysis techniques to derive meaningful answers. The goal is to create compelling narratives that not only reveal insights but also facilitate understanding and decision-making.
Furthermore, the processes used illustrates my fluency of various python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and more.
