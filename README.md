# ES-114-PSDV

This repository contains Python notebooks solving assignments related to Probability, Statistics, and Data Visualization (PSDV) for the ES-114 course.

## Assignments

### [Assignment1_Exploring-Discrete-Random-Variables.ipynb](Assignment1_Exploring-Discrete-Random-Variables.ipynb)

Explore various discrete random variables and compare their Probability Mass Functions (PMFs). Demonstrate the equivalence of Binomial and Poisson distributions for specific parameter ranges.

### [Assignment2_Exploring-Continuous-Random-Variables.ipynb](Assignment2_Exploring-Continuous-Random-Variables.ipynb)

Analyze Continuous Random Variables by plotting their Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs). Compare PDFs with different parameters and plot CDFs for each variable.

### [Assignment3_Image-Histogram-Matching.ipynb](Assignment3_Image-Histogram-Matching.ipynb)

Perform histogram equalization followed by matching of multiple greyscale images.

### [Assignment4_Otsu-Thresholding.ipynb](Assignment4_Otsu-Thresholding.ipynb)

Implement Otsu's Threshold method for binarizing greyscale images. Evaluate the method's performance with varying levels of Gaussian noise.

### [Assignment5_Joint-PMF.ipynb](Assignment5_Joint-PMF.ipynb)

Analyze Joint Probability Mass Functions (PMFs) to determine independence between random variables. Plot PMFs, CDFs, and Marginal PMFs/CDFs. Calculate expected values.

### [Assignment6_Corelation-Coefficient.ipynb](Assignment6_Corelation-Coefficient.ipynb)

Analyze the IRIS dataset to estimate attribute means, variances, and correlation coefficients. Explore correlations within attributes across all species and individually for each species.

### [Assignment7_Principal-Component-Analysis.ipynb](Assignment7_Principal-Component-Analysis.ipynb)

Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the IRIS dataset. Estimate covariance matrix, principal components, and reduce data dimensions. Visualize reduced data points in 2D and 3D, distinguishing between different species.

**Note:** Ensure necessary libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy are installed for running the notebooks effectively.
